# Long-Term Memory

QwenPaw's long-term memory combines the workspace file system with a [ReMe](https://github.com/agentscope-ai/ReMe) personal knowledge base. The user and Agent can maintain `MEMORY.md` together and read it on demand. In the background, ReMe turns useful conversations and currently supported resources into structured Markdown memories, gradually consolidates them into a personal knowledge base, and retrieves the parts relevant to the current question when needed.

In plain language, it works like a research assistant that remembers how an analysis developed and can bring back the evidence. It does six things:

1. **Capture** preferences, facts, judgments, reasoning, and hypotheses to verify;
2. **Ingest** papers and other material from supported external sources;
3. **Consolidate** scattered daily notes into durable knowledge;
4. **Connect** companies, supply chains, conclusions, and evidence with source links and Wikilinks;
5. **Recall** the right information through keywords, semantics, and knowledge relationships;
6. **Expand** from the best excerpts into linked files only when more evidence is needed.

## Optional PowerContext Backend

`remelight` remains the default long-term-memory backend. To use the optional
`powercontext` backend, install the PowerContext memory plugin and deploy or
start a PowerContext Server separately. QwenPaw does not download or start the
server automatically. From a source checkout, build and install the plugin:

```bash
cd plugins/memory/powercontext/frontend
npm install
npm run build
cd ../../../../
qwenpaw plugin install plugins/memory/powercontext
```

For a local server, the default endpoint is `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. Install
and start it with:

```bash
uv tool install "powercontext[cli,server] @ git+https://github.com/oceanbase/powercontext.git@685b31dd2961df5e31daa565f87d004755ebd2cf"
powercontext server run
```

In **Agent Config**, select **PowerContext**, then set its Server URL, optional
Bearer token, memory scope, timeout, automatic-search result limit, and
injected-context budget. Saving schedules an Agent reload; a full QwenPaw
process restart is not required. When selected, QwenPaw sends the current
turn's bounded task state to that configured service
and retrieves relevant memories before later turns. Treat the endpoint and
scope as a data boundary: choose a service and scope that are appropriate for
the conversation data you intend to persist. Leave the memory scope empty to
use the persisted per-installation default
`qwenpaw:<installation_id>:agent:<agent_id>`, which isolates independently
created QwenPaw installations even when they use the same Agent ID and
PowerContext service. Enter the same explicit scope for multiple agents only
when you intend to share their memories. Cloning a QwenPaw working directory
also copies its installation identity; configure an explicit distinct scope
after cloning when the clone must not share memory. Automatic retrieval also
has a configurable total injected-context budget (12,000 UTF-8 bytes by
default), and the request timeout is limited to 1–60 seconds.

### Network and approval boundary

When this backend is enabled, automatic recall and bounded post-turn
persistence are configuration-driven background network operations: they send
the query or bounded turn state to the configured PowerContext service without
an Agent tool call. Disable automatic search or select another backend when
that transmission is not appropriate. In contrast, the Agent-visible
`memory_search` and `memory_remember` tools are governed operations. The
PowerContext search tool is classified as network I/O, so strict governance can
require approval before its query is sent; `memory_remember` is likewise a
network write governed by the active policy.

### PowerContext Configuration

| Field                       | Description                                                       | Default                                                      |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `base_url`                  | PowerContext server URL                                           | `""`                                                         |
| `token`                     | Optional bearer token                                             | `""`                                                         |
| `scope_id`                  | Memory scope; empty selects the isolated installation/Agent scope | `""`                                                         |
| `timeout`                   | Request timeout in seconds, from 1 to 60                          | `10.0`                                                       |
| `auto_memory_search_config` | Automatic recall settings and injected-context byte budget        | `{"enabled":true,"max_results":3,"max_context_bytes":12000}` |

The equivalent `agent.json` fragment is:

```json
{
  "running": {
    "memory_manager_backend": "powercontext",
    "memory_backend_configs": {
      "powercontext": {
        "base_url": "http://127.0.0.1:8000",
        "token": "",
        "scope_id": "",
        "timeout": 10.0,
        "auto_memory_search_config": {
          "enabled": true,
          "max_results": 3,
          "max_context_bytes": 12000
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Plugin configuration belongs under `memory_backend_configs.powercontext`; the
former core-owned `powercontext_memory_config` field is no longer supported.
On first start after an upgrade, the plugin adopts the former root
`powercontext_installation_id` into
`plugin-state/memory-powercontext/installation-id` under the canonical QwenPaw
working directory. This preserves the default scope and existing remote
memories even when an Agent uses a custom workspace path.

## Understand the Memory Loop First

Imagine you are a financial analyst researching the electric-vehicle supply chain. Over several weeks, you discuss CATL's product mix, battery-cell pricing, lithium-carbonate supply and demand, and whether falling lithium prices help battery makers or create inventory write-downs.

If those details remain only in chat logs, the next wave of prices and news soon buries them. QwenPaw preserves the research context, consolidates repeatedly tested conclusions into a personal knowledge base, and retrieves the relevant evidence when you write the next report.

### 1. Memory Starts as Files You Own

QwenPaw and ReMe follow **Memory as File, File as Memory**. Memory is stored as ordinary files in the Agent workspace rather than hidden in an opaque database:

</p>

You can inspect, edit, back up, or migrate these memories directly. Markdown files are the source of truth; search indexes and graphs are derived state that can be rebuilt. Auto-Memory and Auto-Dream do not overwrite `MEMORY.md`, so it is best kept concise and stable.

A durable memory about the EV supply chain might look like this:

```markdown
---
name: Electric-vehicle supply chain
description: Track the transmission from vehicle demand to battery earnings and upstream lithium.
---

# Electric-vehicle supply chain

Vehicle sales affect battery production schedules, which then affect cathode-material and lithium demand.

- Representative battery maker: [[digest/wiki/catl.md]]
- Key cost input: [[digest/wiki/lithium-carbonate.md]]
- Method: [[digest/procedure/battery-earnings-sensitivity.md]]

## Sources

- [[memory/2026-08-14/lithium-price-sensitivity.md]]
```

The body stores the knowledge, frontmatter summarizes it, and `[[...]]` connects sources and related nodes. In this example, “electric-vehicle supply chain” to “CATL” is an **outlink**. ReMe also builds the reverse index, so the CATL node can show which files refer to it—its **inlinks**. The author writes the link once, while retrieval can travel both ways: from an industry to a company, or from a company back to its supply chain and research notes.

#### How Markdown Becomes Searchable Excerpts

ReMe does not simply cut a file every fixed number of characters. The indexer first parses frontmatter and constructs a Markdown AST (abstract syntax tree). Headings form nested sections; paragraphs, lists, tables, and code blocks become leaf nodes. It then chunks the tree recursively and tries to pack adjacent small blocks under the same parent heading.

This has three practical benefits:

- **Meaning stays intact:** a margin discussion under `## CATL` is kept together when possible.
- **Context travels with the excerpt:** a chunk carries the necessary ancestor-heading breadcrumb, so it still makes sense when retrieved alone.
- **Markdown structure survives:** long tables split by row and repeat their headers, long lists split by item, and code blocks retain fences; every chunk keeps its source path and line numbers.

Wikilinks are extracted separately into a file graph. A Markdown file therefore contributes both searchable chunks for BM25/vector retrieval and edges for relationship expansion. Extremely large files with too many headings fall back to plain-text chunking to avoid unnecessary AST overhead.

### 2. Auto-Memory Keeps What Will Matter Later

Auto-Memory does not copy the whole conversation. It periodically identifies durable information such as:

- stable preferences and agreements;
- project context and constraints;
- confirmed decisions and their reasons;
- progress, blockers, and next steps;
- reusable procedures and troubleshooting experience.

If you say, “Add CATL to the priority watchlist; our current hypothesis is that lower lithium-carbonate prices reduce cell costs, but we still need to check inventory write-downs and pricing pass-through,” Auto-Memory keeps the company, current judgment, caveats, follow-up questions, and source. It does not promote a provisional view into a timeless fact.

By default, it runs after every five user turns. If context is evicted or compacted, pending turns enter the same memory flow first. A run that finds nothing worth adding or updating creates neither an empty memory nor an Inbox event.

Auto-Memory stores the source session in a hash-named JSONL file and creates or updates one memory note for that session under the day's date directory:

```text
mem_session/dialog/qpsid_sha256_<64-hex>.jsonl
memory/2026-08-14.md
memory/2026-08-14/lithium-price-sensitivity.md
```

It is important to distinguish the index page from the memory notes. `memory/2026-08-14.md` is an index that ReMe rebuilds from `memory/2026-08-14/*.md`; the actual conversation summary lives in a note under the date directory. The index page looks like this:

```text
---
name: 2026-08-14
description: 2 note(s) today.
---

<!-- notes:auto -->
- [[memory/2026-08-14/catl-earnings-discussion.md]] name: CATL earnings discussion description: Track volume, price, and cost drivers across power batteries and energy storage.
- [[memory/2026-08-14/lithium-price-sensitivity.md]] name: Lithium-price sensitivity description: Analyze effects on cell cost, pricing, and inventory write-downs.
<!-- /notes:auto -->
```

Each index row is rendered from the corresponding note's frontmatter. It includes the link, `name`, `description`, and any other application fields, while internal association fields such as `session_id` and `source_conversation` are hidden. ReMe replaces the entire region between the `notes:auto` markers on refresh, so that region should not be edited manually. Existing frontmatter and body text outside the generated block are preserved.

The `{name}.md` files under the date directory are the session memories produced by Auto-Memory. The first time a session is processed, the system creates at most one note and records both its `session_id` and a `source_conversation` link to the original JSONL. If the same session is processed again on that day, those fields locate the existing note so new facts can be merged into it; the conversation is not split into multiple files merely because it covers several topics. If the model improves the frontmatter `name`, the file is safely renamed and links are retargeted. Put simply, the date file is an automatically maintained contents page, while the files below it are the research workpapers.

For example, the lithium-price sensitivity note retains traceability metadata like this:

```markdown
---
name: Lithium-price sensitivity
description: Analyze effects of falling lithium prices on cell cost, pricing, and inventory write-downs.
session_id: qpsid_sha256_<64-hex>
source_conversation: "[[mem_session/dialog/qpsid_sha256_<64-hex>.jsonl]]"
---

## Current view

Lower lithium prices generally reduce cell material costs, but pricing pass-through and high-cost inventory write-downs still need to be checked.
```

Previously recalled memory is removed before extraction so it cannot be mistaken for a new fact from the user.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i3/O1CN01q1761gvctQB49nzS_!!6000000007099-0-tps-2048-414.jpg" alt="Auto-Memory result delivered to Inbox" />
</p>

Inbox is only a run-status surface. The reusable, editable memory remains in workspace files.

### 3. Auto Resource (Beta) Enriches Memory from External Sources

An analyst's knowledge comes not only from conversation but also from papers, news, and data feeds. **Auto Resource** is the umbrella for this external-material pipeline. It is currently in Beta and continues to expand.

The current built-in capabilities are **Daily Paper** and **Auto Fin**.

When Daily Paper is enabled, QwenPaw selects popular papers related to your interests from the Hugging Face Papers weekly and monthly rankings, saves the source PDFs, and produces three detailed readings plus a daily brief. Setting topics such as `battery, lithium, energy storage`, for example, can continuously add research on battery materials, life prediction, and energy-storage technology.

- PDFs go to `resource/papers/`;
- readings and the brief go to `memory/YYYY-MM-DD/`;
- the Markdown readings enter the normal memory index and can later be consolidated.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i4/O1CN01P4HuDOo3HjE3MD24_!!6000000007223-0-tps-1654-670.jpg" alt="Daily Paper schedule and topic settings" />
</p>

Auto Fin fetches CLS telegraph news from a rolling time window (the preceding 24 hours by default), selects items related to configured topics, and searches ReMe memory for useful historical context. It writes one Chinese research report with validated Wikilinks to `memory/YYYY-MM-DD/auto_fin.md`. Current news and topic-selection results remain in runtime memory; only the final report is persisted. A same-day rerun atomically replaces the existing report with a revision. If no current news is relevant, the job succeeds as a skip without writing a report or sending an Inbox notification.

Auto Fin has no reliable market-price feed, does not calculate returns, targets, or entry points, and is not investment advice. Merely placing an arbitrary file in `resource/` still does not process or index it, so Auto Resource is not a general-purpose file importer. See the [ReMe Auto Fin guide](https://github.com/agentscope-ai/ReMe/blob/main/plugins/auto-fin/README.md) for the complete pipeline and boundaries.

Both generators can also be run manually from a conversation:

```text
/reme daily_paper topics="agents,memory" force=true
/reme auto_fin topics="gold,robotics" window_hours=12
```

Manual execution does not require `daily_paper_cron_enabled` or
`auto_fin_cron_enabled`; those switches control scheduling only. These commands
require approval, then wait for the generation action to finish. Run
`/reme help` to see the precise chat-allowed parameters exposed by the
currently installed plugins. Chat approval is restricted to the originating
user, channel, and session; the authenticated Console can approve as an
administrator.

### 4. Auto-Dream Turns Daily Notes into Durable Knowledge

Daily notes alone eventually become another pile of files. Auto-Dream scans recently changed daily memory and integrates reusable material into `digest/`.

#### First, Classify Three Types of Memory

Auto-Dream first decides which kind of durable memory an item represents. The three types map to different directories and determine how the final note should be written:

| Memory type | What it stores and how it is written                                   | Financial-analyst example                                                      |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `personal`  | Identity, preferences, coverage, and long-term agreements              | Focus on China's EV supply chain and lithium miners                            |
| `procedure` | Reusable workflows written as runbooks with steps, inputs, and caveats | Battery-company earnings-sensitivity analysis                                  |
| `wiki`      | Definitions, facts, observations, principles, and mental models        | CATL, lithium carbonate, inventory write-downs, and lithium-price transmission |

After classification, “what I follow” belongs in `personal/`, “how I should analyze it next time” belongs in `procedure/`, and knowledge about companies, industries, metrics, and their interactions belongs in `wiki/`. Auto-Dream is therefore not merely compressing a journal; it is turning research history into a structured, reusable personal knowledge base.

#### Then, Choose One of Four Integration Actions

After choosing the memory type, Auto-Dream searches existing digest nodes, compares the new material with prior knowledge, and selects exactly one action:

| Action        | Meaning                                                 |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CREATE`      | Create a node when no equivalent knowledge exists       |
| `CORROBORATE` | Add evidence or strengthen an existing memory           |
| `REFINE`      | Add steps, conditions, boundaries, or detail            |
| `CORRECT`     | Fix an error, omission, or conflict in an existing node |

For example, notes from different days might say “lower lithium prices reduce cathode-material costs,” “cell prices may fall as well,” and “high-cost inventory can create a short-term write-down.” Auto-Dream does not isolate any one sentence as the answer. It can consolidate them into a bounded long-term insight:

> Lower lithium prices generally ease battery material costs, but the net effect on CATL's earnings also depends on selling-price pass-through, inventory cost, customer bargaining power, and product mix. The direction of lithium prices alone is insufficient.

In this example, Auto-Dream uses `CREATE` if no lithium-price transmission node exists, `CORROBORATE` if new quarterly data supports the existing view, `REFINE` if the inventory cycle adds an important short-term boundary, and `CORRECT` if the old node overstates the conclusion as “falling lithium prices always benefit CATL.”

#### Finally, Auto-Link Builds the Memory Graph

Auto-Link is the key graph-building stage inside Auto-Dream. It does not wait until consolidation is over and mechanically add links based on filenames. While integrating each memory, the Agent has rich context:

- the memory unit extracted from daily notes and its source paths;
- existing `personal`, `procedure`, and `wiki` nodes recalled by search;
- candidate nodes that have been read and classified as the same knowledge or related knowledge;
- the target node being created or updated, including its existing body.

With this context, the Agent can distinguish “the same knowledge” from “related knowledge.” The former determines which of the four integration actions to take; the latter is woven into natural prose as meaningful Wikilinks. For example: “Lithium prices affect [[digest/wiki/catl.md]]'s material costs through [[digest/wiki/lithium-carbonate.md]]; evaluate the full effect with [[digest/procedure/battery-earnings-sensitivity.md]].” The surrounding sentence explains the relationship instead of leaving a list of context-free links.

Each durable node also uses contextual Wikilinks in `## Sources` to point back to daily notes, preserving the evidence trail from conclusion to source. Wikilinks between digest nodes carry the conceptual graph. The indexer then turns those links into outlinks and inlinks for progressive expansion by Memory Search. Auto-Dream does not rewrite daily memory: `memory/` preserves what was observed and believed at the time, while `digest/` stores conclusions still useful across time. This is how a journal grows into a personal knowledge base.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i1/O1CN01ddkg0rN9DXK49o5c_!!6000000001181-0-tps-2048-796.jpg" alt="Auto-Dream run summary delivered to Inbox" />
</p>

Auto-Dream also writes `interests.yaml`. This is separate from QwenPaw's current `/proactive` mode; `/proactive` does not currently read that file.

### 5. Memory Search Recalls the Right Evidence

When you ask, “Do falling lithium prices benefit CATL?”, `memory_search` does not reread the entire research history. It:

1. uses BM25 to find exact keyword matches;
2. optionally uses Embeddings to find similar meanings expressed with different words;
3. combines both rankings with RRF;
4. attaches the matched file's Wikilink outlinks and inlinks so the Agent can expand them when needed.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i2/O1CN01Zln7TK1TJOGqP84hk_!!6000000002361-55-tps-1200-640.svg" alt="BM25 and vector retrieval are fused before related memory is expanded" />
</p>

BM25 excels at explicit names such as “CATL” and “lithium carbonate.” Vector retrieval can match “how cheaper upstream materials affect a leading cell maker” with a differently worded “lithium-price sensitivity analysis.” RRF (Reciprocal Rank Fusion) combines the rank positions from both branches so that one score scale does not dominate the final order. BM25 and the Wikilink graph still work without an Embedding model. See [Embedding Models](./embedding) for provider configuration.

The personal knowledge base consists of every Markdown file under `daily_dir` (default `memory/`) and `digest_dir` (default `digest/`). The background index watches only those two directories, with a 10 MiB limit per file. It chunks files by Markdown structure and retains paths and line numbers. `MEMORY.md`, `resource/`, and `mem_session/` are not searched directly by ReMe's `memory_search`.

For example, a search for “how falling lithium prices affect CATL's earnings” might return:

```text
========== digest/wiki/catl.md:18-24 [score=0.0325 vector=0.8120 keyword=8.4700] ==========
## Lithium-price earnings sensitivity
Lower lithium prices generally reduce material costs, but the net effect depends on pricing pass-through,
inventory cost, and product mix. See [[digest/wiki/lithium-carbonate.md]] and
[[digest/procedure/battery-earnings-sensitivity.md]].
  outlinks (2):
    → digest/wiki/lithium-carbonate.md  name="Lithium carbonate"
    → digest/procedure/battery-earnings-sensitivity.md  name="Battery earnings sensitivity"
  inlinks (2):
    ← digest/wiki/ev-supply-chain.md  name="Electric-vehicle supply chain"
    ← memory/2026-08-14/catl-earnings-discussion.md  name="CATL earnings discussion"
```

The result starts with the matched excerpt's path and line range, together with keyword, vector, and fused-ranking information. The excerpt itself may contain original Wikilinks. `outlinks` are downstream documents referenced by the hit; `inlinks` are upstream documents that reference it.

This is **progressive hybrid search**. The first step retrieves only the most relevant excerpt. If it cannot yet explain “why,” the Agent can use `read_file` to open the lithium-carbonate node or the analysis procedure. If it needs to verify when the judgment formed, it can follow an inlink to the August 14 discussion. The full knowledge base never has to enter context at once, but the path from conclusion to concept, method, and original note remains available.

`MEMORY.md` is read on demand with file tools; it does not depend on ReMe search.

### The Complete Loop

Returning to the financial-analyst example:

1. In `MEMORY.md`, you record the stable coverage area: EVs, lithium-ion batteries, and lithium resources.
2. Auto-Memory summarizes the day's CATL and lithium-price session into one note under the date directory, then refreshes the day index.
3. Auto Resource adds supported paper readings and financial-research reports to daily memory.
4. Markdown AST chunking, BM25, vector indexes, and the file graph update in the background.
5. Auto-Dream consolidates notes across days into linked `personal`, `procedure`, and `wiki` nodes.
6. Memory Search retrieves the best excerpt for the next report, then expands through paths, outlinks, and inlinks only as needed.
7. You can inspect and correct the Markdown at any time, and those edits guide future work.

### 6. Results: Can It Recall from a Long History?

The EV example above explains the workflow; it is not a quantitative evaluation. ReMe separately uses public benchmarks to test memory across multiple sessions and very long histories:

| Benchmark             | Scale                    | Overall Agentic score |
| --------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------- |
| LongMemEval cleaned-S | 500 questions            | **89.4%**             |
| BEAM 100K             | 20 cases / 400 questions | **66.1%**             |
| BEAM 1M               | 35 cases / 700 questions | **65.0%**             |

![ReMe's published LongMemEval and BEAM benchmark results](https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i4/O1CN01ohO0e31MntKw6mQZL_!!6000000001480-55-tps-1200-640.svg)

These numbers do not represent every real-world workload, and they depend on the model, dataset, and evaluation setup. They show that even as history grows very long, file-based organization, hybrid retrieval, and on-demand expansion can still help an Agent find supporting evidence. See the complete settings and per-category results in the [LongMemEval benchmark](https://github.com/agentscope-ai/ReMe/tree/main/benchmark/longmemeval) and [BEAM benchmark](https://github.com/agentscope-ai/ReMe/tree/main/benchmark/beam).

## Configuration Reference

The default `remelight` backend runs inside the QwenPaw process and reuses the current Agent's model for memory extraction and consolidation. Configure it in the Console or under `running.reme_light_memory_config` in `agent.json`.

Automatic results are injected only into the current request. They are excluded from persistent conversation history and Auto-Memory. Automation-originated requests do not trigger automatic search.

### Directory and Index Configuration

| ------------------------ | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `metadata_dir`           | `"mem_metadata"` | Indexes, graph data, catalogs, and caches                           |
| `session_dir`            | `"mem_session"`  | Auto-Memory source-conversation directory                           |
| `mem_session_dir`        | `"mem_agent"`    | Internal ReMe memory-agent sessions                                 |
| `resource_dir`           | `"resource"`     | Raw resources for Daily Paper and future workflows                  |
| `daily_dir`              | `"memory"`       | Daily memory directory                                              |
| `digest_dir`             | `"digest"`       | Durable knowledge directory                                         |
| `embedding_model_config` | Disabled         | Optional vector model; see [Embedding Models](./embedding)          |
| `needs_reindex`          | `false`          | Runtime-maintained pending-rebuild flag after a vector-space change |

Legacy `inbox_push_enabled` is migration input only. It initializes any missing switches for the four Inbox-producing memory jobs but is not serialized back into validated configuration.

### Runtime Status and Rebuilding the Index

The long-term memory page shows background jobs, the waiting queue, resource use, and index-component status.

Conversation capture uses one FIFO Auto-Memory worker per Agent. Periodic
capture, `/reme auto_memory`, context compaction, and `/new` all submit work to
this same queue; each status record identifies its `periodic`, `manual`,
`compact`, or `new` trigger. Use `/auto_memory_status` to inspect these tasks
from a conversation. Run `/reme help` to inspect the live, chat-safe ReMe
action catalog. QwenPaw explicitly allows `status`, `search`, `proactive`,
`auto_memory`, `auto_dream`, `daily_paper`, and `auto_fin`; raw vault and index
maintenance actions are not callable from chat.
Shutdown uses one five-second deadline to stop this worker,
quiesce active ReMe jobs, and close ReMe; it reports failure instead of waiting
indefinitely or replacing a backend that is still in use. ReMe maintenance
operations such as graph snapshots, reindexing, and embedding rollback use the
memory-action interface, validate arguments against each action's full JSON
Schema, and do not enter the Auto-Memory queue. Run those maintenance operations
through the authenticated Console or maintenance API rather than `/reme`.

</p>

Normal Markdown additions and edits are indexed incrementally. Use **Rebuild Memory Index** only when the Console reports a vector-space change, the index is damaged, or search is clearly abnormal. The maintenance API supports scoped rebuilds:

```http
POST /api/agents/{agentId}/memory/reindex?scope=all
POST /api/agents/{agentId}/memory/reindex?scope=bm25
POST /api/agents/{agentId}/memory/reindex?scope=embedding
```

`bm25` rebuilds only the keyword index, `embedding` rebuilds only vectors, and the default `all` rebuilds BM25 first and Embedding second. The `embedding` and `all` scopes require an enabled Embedding configuration and return HTTP `409` otherwise; use `bm25` when no vector model is configured. A rebuild uses the already-ingested chunks from `memory/` and `digest/`; it does not reparse or delete source memory and does not rebuild the Wikilink graph. CPU and memory use may rise, and only one rebuild can run per Agent.

After an Embedding change, vector search remains unavailable until an `embedding` or `all` rebuild succeeds; BM25 remains available. To abandon a pending vector-space change before rebuilding, use the Console undo action or call:

```http
POST /api/agents/{agentId}/memory/reindex/undo
```

Undo restores the previous Embedding configuration that matches the existing vectors. It does not delete memory files and is available only while a rebuild-requiring change is pending.

## Other Memory Backends

QwenPaw's memory system uses a pluggable backend architecture. ReMeLight remains
the built-in default; ADBPG and PowerContext are independently installable
plugins. If the selected plugin is missing or fails to load when an Agent
starts, the runtime temporarily uses ReMeLight while preserving the configured
backend and its plugin settings. The fallback is recorded in the logs. Reload
the Agent after the plugin becomes available to restore the configured backend.
Select a backend via `memory_manager_backend`; plugin-owned per-Agent settings
are stored under `memory_backend_configs.<backend_id>`.

### ADBPG (AnalyticDB for PostgreSQL)

A long-term memory backend backed by a cloud vector database. It is suitable for scenarios that need cross-device sharing or large-scale semantic retrieval. QwenPaw connects through the ADBPG memory service REST API, so no additional database driver is required.

**Key features:**

- **Cross-session persistence** — Extracted memories are stored remotely and can be retrieved across sessions and devices.
- **Server-side fact extraction** — New user messages are submitted each normal conversation turn; the service extracts facts asynchronously.
- **REST API access** — Calls the ADBPG memory service over HTTP.
- **Graceful degradation** — When ADBPG is unreachable, the agent keeps running normally; only the long-term memory feature is temporarily disabled.

**How to configure:**

From a source checkout, build and install the plugin first:

```bash
cd plugins/memory/adbpg/frontend
npm ci
npm run build
cd ../../../../
qwenpaw plugin install plugins/memory/adbpg
```

A published plugin ZIP includes the configuration UI, so no source build is
needed. With QwenPaw running, upload it from the Console's plugin page or run
`qwenpaw plugin install /path/to/memory-adbpg-1.0.0.zip`. For source-directory
installation, start QwenPaw afterward if it was stopped; a running QwenPaw uses
the hot-install API.

Then open the agent's "Running Config" tab in the Console, locate the
"Long-term Memory Management Backend" dropdown, choose `adbpg`, and fill in
`REST Base URL` and `REST API Key` under the ADBPG configuration tab.

> Saving a backend selection or plugin configuration schedules an Agent reload.
> A changed backend or effective configuration creates a new backend instance;
> unchanged backend context can reuse the existing instance. A full process
> restart is not required.

Before uninstalling or force-reinstalling the
plugin, switch all Agents using it to another backend, such as `none`, and wait
for their reloads and outstanding memory work to finish. An in-use memory
backend cannot be uninstalled.

> Migration note: ADBPG direct SQL mode has been removed. Old fields such as
> `api_mode: "sql"`, `host`, `port`, `user`, `password`, `dbname`, and LLM /
> Embedding settings are ignored; configure `rest_base_url` and `rest_api_key`
> instead.

| Field                       | Description                                                                              | Default                               |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |

| `rest_api_key`              | Access key for the REST API                                                              | `""`                                  |
| `memory_isolation`          | Memory isolation mode: `true` for per-agent, `false` for shared                          | `true`                                |
| `search_timeout`            | Memory search timeout (seconds)                                                          | `10.0`                                |
| `auto_memory_search_config` | Auto memory search configuration; same shape as ReMe Light's `auto_memory_search_config` | `{"enabled": true, "max_results": 3}` |

**Submission, extraction, and failures:**

The service extracts facts asynchronously by default. A `completed` auto-memory
task describes client-side processing: for messages actually sent, it confirms
only that the HTTP submission was accepted. Extraction may still be running,
so a fact may not be immediately searchable. Ask the Agent to remember a fact,
allow time for server-side processing, and retrieve it in a later turn. Check
`/auto_memory_status` and logs for submission results. Backend shutdown attempts to drain
queued submissions within its timeout; it does not wait for server-side
extraction to finish.

**Isolation scope:**

With `memory_isolation: true`, remote `agent_id` is the current Agent ID; with
`false`, it is `shared`. Both modes use `shared` for `user_id` and for `run_id`
on writes. Search filters include only `agent_id` and `user_id`, so isolation
is per Agent, not per chat user or session. Shared-mode Agents in the same
service dataset share remote memories. Changing the setting switches the
read/write namespace without migrating existing memories. Local Markdown
files still belong to each Agent's workspace.

**Configuration example:**

The full configuration can be written into
`running.memory_backend_configs.adbpg` in `agent.json`:

```json
{
  "running": {
    "memory_manager_backend": "adbpg",
    "memory_backend_configs": {
      "adbpg": {
        "rest_base_url": "https://your-adbpg-memory-api.example.com",
        "rest_api_key": "your-rest-api-key",
        "memory_isolation": true,
        "search_timeout": 10.0,
        "auto_memory_search_config": {
          "enabled": true,
          "max_results": 3
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> 💡 When you fill these fields in the Console "Running Config" page, the framework writes them into `agent.json` automatically — no need to edit the file by hand.

The former core-owned `running.adbpg_memory_config` field is no longer
supported. Install the plugin and move its values to
`running.memory_backend_configs.adbpg` before starting the Agent.
