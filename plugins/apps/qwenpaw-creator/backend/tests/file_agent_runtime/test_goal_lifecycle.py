"""Driver incident regressions: the Session must never stay wedged.

Terminal goals: resuming after the mainline Goal reached COMPLETED bound a
fresh QUEUED run to the dead Goal. The dispatcher refuses to start runs on
terminal Goals and admission rejects every later message with "Active Goal
is terminal", deadlocking the Session until the runtime records were
repaired by hand.

Stop under polling: steady UI polling took shared Runtime locks, the stop's
exclusive writes lost the lock race on every poll tick, and the dock showed
「正在停止所有 Agent」 forever.
