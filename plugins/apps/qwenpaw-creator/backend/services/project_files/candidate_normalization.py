"""Deterministic pre-validation normalization of jq_project candidates.

Models repeatedly emit harmless *identity echoes*: denormalized id fields
inside EntityCollection items whose value merely repeats the collection key
or the owning parent's id (for example ``entityId`` inside a VisualVariant).
StrictModel rejects them as ``extra_forbidden``, costing one full recovery
turn even though the payload carries zero new information.

This layer strips such echoes deterministically before schema validation.
Admission criteria for every rule — all four must hold:

1. Provably zero information loss: the stripped value must be derivable
   from the candidate itself (equal to the collection key or parent id).
   On any mismatch the field is left intact so validation reports it.
2. Grounded in observed model behavior from real session traces.
3. Deterministic: pure structural comparison, never guessing or coercion.
   Value rewrites and structural repair are out of scope by design.
4. Receipted: every strip is reported as a JSON Pointer so the tool result
   tells the model what was removed, and rule hit-rates stay observable.
