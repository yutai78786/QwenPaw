"""Render self-review loop: frame evidence → VLM review → advisory feedback.

The loop is an adviser, never a gate: it runs detached after a final
composition is published, writes its reports under the Project's
``runtime/render-review/`` directory and, on a revise verdict, hands the
structured findings to the next AI editing director specialist run as a
turn user message (admitted through the durable session boundary). After
``MAX_REVIEW_ROUNDS`` the chain closes and delivery proceeds regardless of
the verdict, with the reports retained beside the render.
