"""Runtime→Agent notification bus (steer / inject delivery primitives).

Background work (the work-graph scheduler, and later asynchronous
specialists) reports back to the mainline Agent through this bus.  Two
delivery primitives, aligned with the Codex subagent-notification and
DeepSeek-Harness inject/steer models:

- ``steer`` (NEXT_STEP events): the fact requires an Agent action and no
  other mechanism will bring the Agent back.  It becomes one durable
  user-role RUNTIME-channel session message immediately (idempotent by
  ``client_message_id``) and wakes the dispatcher: an idle session starts
  a run within one poll interval, a busy session consumes it right after
  the current run — the mainline is never interrupted mid-run.

- ``inject`` (QUIET events): informational progress that must not spend a
  model run on its own.  It is staged in the per-project notification
  outbox and rides along with the next steer message or the end-of-run
  resume digest.

The session message log stays the single inbox; the outbox is only a
staging area whose content always ends up folded into inbox messages.

Delivery is idempotent end to end: every event carries a ``request_id``
anchored to the underlying fact (node fingerprint, project generation,
specialist run id), deduplicated once against the outbox history for
quiet events and once against the session log's ``client_message_id``
for steer messages.

        The caller (dispatcher reconcile) guarantees the session is idle:
        no active run, no queued user messages, no active review, no
        in-flight specialists.  Every parked event is delivered as its
        own message under its steer identity with its original kind and
        payload metadata — flattening a SUBAGENT_TERMINAL into a text
        digest would strip the delegation-origin identity that repair
        dedup and the paid repair budget key on.  Quiet records ride
        along with the first delivery; the wave is capped by the
        remaining flush budget.
