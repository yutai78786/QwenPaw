"""Event-driven scheduler that fans out READY media nodes in parallel.

The model plans; the Runtime executes. Media generation parameters are
deterministically assembled from project.json, so once the work graph
marks a media node READY there is nothing left that needs a model turn
— the scheduler dispatches it directly, several at a time, bounded by
``media_parallelism`` on top of the global model_slot semaphores.

Safety posture:
- Only runs for projects in the unattended ladder
  (execution_authorization=allow_all); otherwise the graph stays a
  read-only view and behavior is unchanged.
- A node is dispatched at most once per input fingerprint: FAILED nodes
  are *not* retried until a prompt or upstream selection actually
  changes (no paid retry loops). Manual dispatch via the API bypasses
  this ledger deliberately.
- Write-back safety comes from the existing commit boundary (field-level
  merge over disjoint pointers) and the durable idempotency slots.
