/**
 * Turn-completion plumbing for tool cards.
 *
 * A tool card only sees its own message, and a call block without a result
 * block looks identical whether the tool is still running or the turn was
 * interrupted: the call message is already `completed` once its arguments
 * finished streaming, and a cancelled turn never sends the result message.
 *
 * Two facts close such a dangling call, both resolved here:
 *
 * - the response reached a terminal status — the SDK flips it to canceled on
 *   stop, and restored history is always terminal;
 * - the user stopped the turn while its stream was already dead, in which case
 *   the SDK never got to write that status (see stoppedTurns).
 *
 * Indirect signals (bubble position, the chat-wide loading flag) are
 * deliberately not used: neither means "this turn can still emit events", and
 * they reported healthy calls as interrupted mid-turn.
